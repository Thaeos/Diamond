# Zapper + DeBank — round up the chaos

When you’ve been testing the waters for a year you usually leave a **digital trail** across 15+ chains and a dozen obscure protocols. Here’s an efficient way to use **Zapper** (and **DeBank**) to round it all up.

---

## 1. The “Bundle” strategy

Don’t just connect one wallet.

- Use the **Zapper search bar** to look up addresses (yours or old ones you find).
- Hit **Follow** on each one to create a **Bundle**.
- One view = combined history and assets of every wallet you’ve ever touched.

---

## 2. Hunting for “ghost” assets

Once connected, focus on:

| Tab | What to do |
|-----|------------|
| **Apps / DeFi** | Where Zapper shines. It digs into protocols for liquidity you provided or rewards you forgot. Scans Aave, Uniswap, and hundreds of others automatically. |
| **NFTs** | Pulls in every test mint or random airdrop across Ethereum, Polygon, Base, etc. |
| **Activity** | Use the **Filter** tool. Filter by **Protocol** or **Chain** to see exactly where you were interacting months ago. |

---

## 3. Pro tip: check “Hidden” folders

- “Junk” or forgotten tokens are sometimes filtered out to keep the UI clean.
- Check **settings** or scroll to the **bottom of your token list** for low-value or unverified tokens Zapper tucked away.

---

## 4. Cross-reference with DeBank

- Keep **Zapper** and **DeBank** both open.
- **Zapper** — better for social/activity and clean UI.
- **DeBank** — often picks up very obscure “shitcoins” or tiny gas dust that Zapper might miss.

---

## 5. Breadcrumbs

- **Old transaction hashes** or **exchange withdrawal emails** are the best breadcrumbs to find addresses you’ve forgotten.
- Use those to search in Zapper (and DeBank), then add them to your Bundle.

---

## Summary

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Bundle | Search addresses in Zapper → Follow each → one combined view. |
| Ghost assets | Apps/DeFi, NFTs, Activity (filter by protocol/chain). |
| Hidden | Settings or bottom of token list for low-value/unverified. |
| Cross-ref | DeBank for obscure tokens and dust Zapper might miss. |
| Breadcrumbs | Tx hashes, withdrawal emails → find forgotten addresses. |

Zapper + DeBank = part of the map (portfolio/activity aggregation). See **THE_MAP.md**.
